## Inspiration
Communicating health concerns can be overwhelming — especially when symptoms are complex, emotions run high, or language barriers exist. We believe that everyone deserves to be heard and understood, no matter how they express themselves. Inspired by the need for clearer, more accessible healthcare communication, we set out to build something that bridges the gap between patients and providers. Our goal was to turn unstructured, everyday speech from any language (spoke or text-based) into structured, meaningful reports that streamline care and improve triage. Through TriageMate, we aim to empower individuals to speak freely, in any language, and ensure that their needs are captured accurately and compassionately — helping healthcare professionals deliver the right care, faster.

## What it does
TriageMate is an AI-powered hospital triage assistant that streamlines symptom reporting and risk assessment — where smart tech meets compassionate care. Our application transforms the traditional triage experience by enabling users to describe their symptoms through voice or text in any language, which is then intelligently translated, analyzed, and structured into a concise report for healthcare providers. Whether you're managing patient flow, reducing language barriers, or enhancing clinical decision-making, TriageMate empowers both patients and healthcare teams with faster, smarter, and more accessible triage.
